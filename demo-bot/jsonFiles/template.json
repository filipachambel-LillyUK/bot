AFPs include programs where coverage, reimbursement, or patient out of pocket costs for a product in some way vary based on the availability of a manufacturer co-pay program. AFPs may modify, delay, deny, restrict, or withhold insurance benefits or coverage from patients, or exclude Lilly products from coverage contingent upon a member's use of Trulicity Savings Card Program. You agree to inform Trulicity Savings Card Program if you are or become a member of such an alternative funding program. You are responsible for any applicable taxes, fees, and any amount that exceeds the monthly or annual maximum Card savings. Monthly and annual maximum savings are set at Lilly's sole and absolute discretion and may be changed with or without notice at any time for any reason. At its sole discretion and with or without notice, Lilly may reduce, eliminate, or otherwise modify the Card savings for any reason, including but not limited to if your commercial drug insurance plan imposes additional requirements which limits or prevents you from receiving coverage for Trulicity, only allows partial coverage for Trulicity, removes coverage for Trulicity and requires you to utilize the Card, does not provide a material level of financial assistance for the cost of Trulicity, or does not apply Card payments to satisfy your co-payment, deductible, or coinsurance for Trulicity. Card savings are not valid for: Massachusetts residents if an AB-rated generic equivalent is available; California residents if an FDA-approved therapeutic equivalent is available. You must meet the Card eligibility criteria, terms and conditions every time you use the Card. Card activation is required. No party may seek reimbursement from your health insurance, any third party, or any health savings, flexible spending, or other healthcare reimbursement accounts, for any amount of the savings received through the Card. By utilizing the Card, you agree that if you are required to do so under the terms of your insurance coverage for this prescription or are otherwise required to do so by law, you will notify your Insurance Carrier of your redemption of the Card. Card savings cannot be combined or utilized with any other program, discount, discount card, cash discount card, coupon, incentive, or similar offer involving Trulicity. You agree that this Card savings is intended solely for the benefit of you, the patient, and that the Card benefits are nontransferable. It is prohibited for any person to sell, purchase, or trade; or to offer to sell, purchase, or trade, or to counterfeit the Card. The Card is not insurance. Lilly has the sole right to interpret and apply Card eligibility criteria, and terms and conditions. Card eligibility, and terms and conditions may be terminated, rescinded, revoked, or amended by Lilly at any time without notice and for any reason. Eligibility criteria, and terms and conditions for the Trulicity Savings Card Program may change from time to time; the most current version can be found at https://www.Trulicity.com. You may be required to obtain a new Card, including if any Card terms and conditions have been terminated, rescinded, revoked, or amended by Lilly. Card void where prohibited by law.
